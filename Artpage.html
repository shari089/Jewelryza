                <span class="description-2" style="top: 220.2vh"> The house sparrow is adaptable and thrives near humans, commonly found in urban areas where it benefits from food and nesting opportunities. Its diet includes seeds, grains, and insects. These social birds often gather in flocks, communicating with various chirps. Known for their energetic behavior, they hop on the ground and perch on structures. They build nests in available crevices using twigs, grasses, and feathers. House sparrows are important for ecosystems as prey and seed dispersers. However, some populations have declined due to urban changes and food availability, leading to conservation efforts to protect these familiar birds.</span>
